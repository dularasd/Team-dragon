# Team-dragon

## Overview
This project is a functional quadcopter drone designed and developed by a collaborative team, integrating key technologies in **aerodynamics**, **embedded systems**, and **real-time control**. The drone is capable of stable autonomous flight with optimized responsiveness and flight performance.

## üîß Key Features
- **Custom-designed airframe** for aerodynamic efficiency
- **Embedded microcontroller** (e.g., STM32, Arduino, ESP32) running real-time firmware
- **PID-based flight control system**
- **IMU integration** (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer)
- **Wireless telemetry and remote control**
- **Failsafe and recovery modes**
- Modular hardware and codebase for easy extensibility

## üöÄ Technologies Used
- **C/C++** for embedded firmware
- **Python/Processing** for telemetry/ground station (optional)
- **Fusion 360 / SolidWorks** for CAD modeling
- **KiCad / Eagle** for PCB design
- **Matplotlib / MATLAB** for flight data analysis
- **FreeRTOS** for real-time scheduling (if applicable)
